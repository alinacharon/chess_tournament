Running flake8 and Generating HTML Report
To ensure code quality, you can run flake8 with a line length limit of 119 characters and generate an HTML report.

Install flake8:

pip install flake8

Create a .flake8 configuration file:

[flake8]
max-line-length = 119
Run flake8 and generate the HTML report:

flake8 --format=html --htmldir=flake8_reports

This command will generate an HTML report in the flake8_reports directory. Open index.html in a web browser to view the detailed flake8 analysis.
